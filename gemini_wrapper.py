{conversation_context}Document Content:

Question: {question}

Instructions:
- Consider the conversation context when answering
- If the question refers to "it", "this", "that", or "more details", refer to the previous conversation
- If asked about current date/time, use the provided current date and time above
- Search through the document content for relevant information
- If asking about competencies, skills, services, or capabilities, provide the COMPLETE list from the documents
- Do not truncate lists - include ALL items mentioned in the documents
- If the documents contain the answer, use that information
- CRITICAL: If you see "[IMAGE_X: path]" references in the content, you MUST include them EXACTLY in your answer
- CRITICAL: If you see "[IMAGES_AVAILABLE: X images extracted]", you MUST mention this in your response
- CRITICAL: When answering about visual content (charts, diagrams, processes), ALWAYS include any image references found
- CRITICAL: Copy image references exactly as they appear: [IMAGE_0: full_path]
- If the documents do NOT contain the answer, respond ONLY with: "GLOBAL_SEARCH_NEEDED"
- Do NOT explain that the document doesn't contain the information
- Do NOT mention the document at all if it doesn't have the answer
- Either provide the document-based answer (including any image references EXACTLY as found) OR respond with exactly "GLOBAL_SEARCH_NEEDED"
